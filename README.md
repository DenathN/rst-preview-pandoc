# Markdown Preview package

Show the pandoc-rendered HTML markdown to the right of the current editor using
`ctrl-shift-m`

Live Update scrolls to cursor position when editing. You can also toggle scrolling preview together with editor (like StackEdit for example).

It can be activated from the editor using the `ctrl-shift-m` key-binding and is
currently enabled for `.markdown`, `.md`, `.mdown`, `.mkd`, `.mkdown`, `.ron`, and `.txt` files.
